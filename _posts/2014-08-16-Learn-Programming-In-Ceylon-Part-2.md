title: Learn Programming in Ceylon - Part 2
---

## Introduction

In [Part 1](http://renatoathaydes.github.io/Learn-Programming-In-Ceylon-Part-1) of this series, we had a look at quite a
lot of concepts! We saw how to get started with Ceylon and its IDE, what types (`String`, `Boolean` etc) and values
(`"Hello"`, `true`) are, functions (`function add(Float x, Float y) => x * y`), lists (Sequences and Tuples: `[1, 2, 3]`,
Iterables: `{'a', 'b', 'c'}`), loops (`for` and `while`), conditionals (`if` `then` `else`), comprehensions
(`{ for (a in as) a.something }`), and finally, variadic parameters (`function takeManyStrings(String* strings) => ...`).

We also created a first, more or less complete program, the *Maths Helper*, that allows users to do some simple maths.

In this part of the series, we will start looking at some more advanced concepts, such as union types, switches,
custom types, enumerated types, polymorphism, generics and finally, mutability and data structures.

> Ceylon discourages the use of mutability. By default, everything in Ceylon is immutable.
  We will discuss why that is in the last section of this tutorial.

These concepts will allow you to tackle problems with a high level of complexity in a manageable manner.

To get started, let's have a look at one of the most innovative features of Ceylon: union types.

## Union types

You might remember the `askUserForNumber` function, from Part 1, which asked the user for a Number and returned either
the number the user entered or `null`, ie. no value, if the user did not enter a valid number:

{% highlight ceylon %}
Float? askUserForNumber(String question) { ... }
{% endhighlight %}

We already mentioned then that `Float?` is just short notation for the type `Float | Null`, which reads as `Float or Null`.

This is called a **union type**.

> A union type is a type formed by two or more different types. A value always has a single type, but a function may accept
or return values of different types. That's the main reason union types exist.

To try this out, you can use the following code (don't forget, this must be inside the `run` function):

{% highlight ceylon %}
Float? askUserForNumber(String question) {
	process.write(question);
	value userX = process.readLine();
	return parseFloat(userX);
}

value x = askUserForNumber("Enter a number (x): ");
print(x exists then "Thank you!" else "Sorry, that's not a number.");
{% endhighlight %}

> We show above how you can use `then` ... `else` directly in a single expression... you just need something that evaluates
to a Boolean before `then`, and an expression that evaluates to some value in case that's true and another in case
that's false.

Any number of types can be part of a union. Here are some examples:

{% highlight ceylon %}
void show(String|Boolean|Integer input) {
    String type;
    if (is String input) {
        type = "String";
    } else if (is Boolean input) {
        type = "Boolean";
    } else {
        type = "Integer";
    }
    print("``type``: ``input``");
}

show("hello"); // prints 'String: hello'
show(true);    // prints 'Boolean: true'
show(400);     // prints 'Integer: 400'

// convert a String into an Integer, Float or Boolean, whatever possible,
// or just return the String itself if none was possible.
Integer|Float|Boolean|String convert(String string) {
    return parseInteger(string) 
    else parseFloat(string)
    else parseBoolean(string)
    else string;
}

assert(convert("true") is Boolean);
assert(convert("1") is Integer);
assert(convert("1.0") is Float);
assert(convert("Just String") is String);
{% endhighlight %}

These examples are a little bit artificial but should already show the possibilities union types bring to the table.
To truly understand how union types can be extremely useful, however, we must first learn how to define our own types.

> A particularly useful construct to deal with union types is the `switch`, which we will meet soon.

## Defining our own types

All types we have talked about so far (`String`, `Boolean`, `Float`, `Integer`, `Character`) are defined by Ceylon itself
and available to any Ceylon program. We can achieve a lot using only these types, but to model the real world, it is very
convenient to be able to define our own types so that it becomes more natural to reason about the problems we are trying
to solve.

In Ceylon, there are four different ways one can define a type:

* `alias`
* `class`
* `interface`
* `abstract class`

The easiest way to define a type is to just borrow an existing definition and call it our own! That's what `alias` does.

## Alias

Sometimes, we want to declare a type which is very simple, or similar to another existing type, but we still believe it
would be useful to create that type to make code easier to understand.

A common use-case for this is to keep people's names. A `String` might seem adequate enough for a simple name, but that
would allow empty names to exist. So we may want to use `[Character+]` instead. And perhaps a sequence of `[Character+]`
for the full name. The problem is that we would end up with types like this:

{% highlight ceylon %}
// parse a name, returning either a full name or null if the given input was empty
[[Character+]+]? parseName(String input) { ... }
{% endhighlight %}

But we can make code like this much more readable by defining some aliases, as in this example:

{% highlight ceylon %}
alias Name => [Character+];
alias FullName => [Name+];

// parse a name, returning either a full name or null if the given input was empty
FullName? parseName(String input) {
    function stringAsSequence(String s) => s.trimmed.sequence;
    value parts = [ for (part in input.split().map(stringAsSequence))
                    if (nonempty part) part ];
    if (nonempty parts) {
        return parts;
    } else {
        return null;
    }
}

FullName? myName = parseName("Renato Athaydes");
assert(is FullName myName, myName == ["Renato", "Athaydes"]);

FullName? noname = parseName("");
assert(noname is Null);

FullName? emptyName = parseName("    ");
assert(emptyName is Null);
{% endhighlight %}

Aliases can also be useful to make large union types nicer on the eye. For example, we could improve the declaration of
`convert` in the previous section by defining an alias for `Integer|Float|Boolean|String`:

{% highlight ceylon %}
alias Convertable => Integer|Float|Boolean|String;

Convertable convert(String string) {
    return parseInteger(string) 
    else parseFloat(string)
    else parseBoolean(string)
    else string;
}
{% endhighlight %}

This is especially useful when such kind of type appears in a lot of places, so you don't need to re-write (or read) the
large type name again and again.

> Aliases do not actually create new types, they simply 'rename' an existing type or a simple type expression.

## Custom types with classes

Imagine we want to model playing cards to create a cards game. With what we know so far, we would have to improvise and use
types like `String` and `Integer`, or some aliases, to represent the cards. That might actually work, but there's a much
nicer way to model things in Ceylon: to create a `class` for the object you want to model.

A simple class declaration may look like the following:

{% highlight ceylon %}
class Card(shared Integer rank, shared Integer suit) {}

value card = Card(5, 3);
assert(card.rank == 5);
assert(card.suit == 3);
{% endhighlight %}

The above declaration defines a class called `Card` which contains the fields `rank` and `suit`. Because the fields are
shared, they can be accessed as *properties* of a card instance.

Using `Integer` as the type of both rank and suit seems misguided. What would the Integer corresponding to *hearts*, or
*Queen*, be? We can do much better than that by defining more new types for these as well:

{% highlight ceylon %}
// suites
class Spades() {}
class Diamonds() {}
class Hearts() {}
class Clubs() {}

// ranks
class Ace() {}
class Jack() {}
class Queen() {}
class King() {}

alias Rank => Integer|Ace|Jack|Queen|King;
alias Suit => Spades|Diamonds|Hearts|Clubs;

// definition of a playing card
class Card(shared Rank rank, shared Suit suit) {}

// example of a card
Card aceOfSpades = Card(Ace(), Spades());
{% endhighlight %}

This is looking good, but there's a problem with our definition of `Rank`: it still allows any `Integer` to be a valid
rank, but as we know, in any game of cards, the rank it limited to just a few numbers, besides *Ace*, *Jack*, *Queen*
and *King*.

The first solution that might come to mind might be to modify the `Card` class declaration to check that the value provided
for the rank is valid in case it is an `Integer` (in the other cases, no check is needed, of course):

{% highlight ceylon %}
class Card(shared Rank rank, shared Suit suit) {
    if (is Integer rank) {
        assert(rank in 2..7);
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

That is a valid solution, it makes it impossible for anyone to instantiate an invalid card. But it makes it possible to
*try* to instantiate an invalid card, which would result in an Error!

{% highlight ceylon %}
// this will throw an Error
value invalidCard = Card(300, Hearts());
print("Will never get here");
{% endhighlight %}

An arguably better solution would be to enumerate each valid value, just like we did for `Suit`:

{% highlight ceylon %}
// ranks
class Ace() {}
class Two() {}
class Three() {}
class Four() {}
class Five() {}
class Six() {}
class Seven() {}
class Jack() {}
class Queen() {}
class King() {}

alias Rank => Ace|Two|Three|Four|Five|Six|Seven|Jack|Queen|King;
{% endhighlight %}

Now it is just impossible to even try to instantiate an invalid card! The problem is that enumerating all values might not
be always possible. In that case, the previous solution might be the only viable alternative. But keep in mind that every
time you run into this problem, you should try to minimize the possibility of a run-time error being possible, as that can
quickly become un-manageable and is the source of countless bugs in real software.

## Interfaces

Quite often, we come across concepts which have the same kind of properties, but differ only in the details of how they behave.
Continuing with our game, we may think of one example of this as being a dealer. Whatever the game we decide to create
may be, we will probably need a dealer. There are many things a dealer can do, and most of them do not depend on which
game is being played, such as dealing the cards, shuffling and perhaps comparing players' hands.

This is a good example of where we could use an `interface` to model a fairly abstract concept.

> An interface is an abstract definition of a particular concept which we want to model. In other words, it can be seen
  as a contract which may be satisfied by concrete or abstract classes to provide the actual behavior.

Before we define our first interface, we must formally define what a `method` is:

> A method is simply a shared function that is declared inside a class or interface. It is useful to make that distinction
  because methods can have access to internals of a class which are not available to other functions, so methods, unlike
  functions, can be seen as being an integral part of the class or interface in which they are defined.

Ok, now that we know the theory, let's give that a go:

{% highlight ceylon %}
// first, some definitions
alias Hand => {Card*};
alias Pack => {Card+};

interface Dealer {    
    shared formal Pack shuffle(Pack pack);
    
    shared formal Hand dealHand(Pack cards);
    
    shared formal Comparison compareHands(Hand hand1, Hand hand2);
    
    shared default {Hand+} deal(Pack cards, Integer playersCount) =>
        (1..playersCount).map((Integer i) => dealHand(cards));
        
}
{% endhighlight %}

> Notice that each method of an interface which does not have a default implementation must be declared `formal`.
  Default implementations can be provided and must be declared `default`.

`Dealer` is just a concept, it does not define how to do anything (notice how the formal methods have no body)
except for the trivial case of defining the `deal` method, as that can be easily done in terms of the formal method
`dealHand`, even if we do not yet have a concrete implementation of that method. The actual behavior of a `Dealer` must
be provided by implementation classes.

This is very useful as it allows us to write other parts of the game which do not depend upon the specific rules of our
game before we even know what our game rules are going to look like. And notice that there could even be more than one
game (and therefore different implementations of `Dealer`), but the parts of the game which will not be impacted by the
specifics of each game can still be written only once.

Notice that, because interfaces do not implement all the behavior that would be necessary to actually use an instance of
it, you cannot instantiate an interface directly!

The following results in a compiler error (so you can't even run this program):

{% highlight ceylon %}
// does not compile!
value dealer = Dealer();

// what would this return if this compiled?
value hand = dealer.dealHand(pack);
{% endhighlight %}

For this reason, before we can instantiate a subtype of `Dealer`, we will have to provide at least one implementation for it.

To implement an interface is very simple. You must provide an implementation for each **formal** method. Here's a "dummy"
implementation of the `Dealer` interface defined above:
 
{% highlight ceylon %}
class DummyDealer() satisfies Dealer {
    
    shared actual Pack shuffle(Pack pack) => pack;
    
    shared actual Hand dealHand(Pack cards) => { Card(Ace(), Hearts()) };

    shared actual Comparison compareHands(Hand hand1, Hand hand2) => larger;
    
}
{% endhighlight %}

This kind of "dummy" implementation (it is called dummy because it does not really implement the behavior, notice how
`shuffle` does not really shuffle the pack, and `dealHand` just returns the same hand every time)is useful for developing
large systems gradually so you don't need to implement the whole system before you can even run anything.

Ceylon has a nice short notation for writing `actual` methods with expression (using `=>`): you can just omit everything
before the name of the method, so the above definition could be written more concisely as:

{% highlight ceylon %}
class DummyDealer() satisfies Dealer {
    
    shuffle(Pack pack) => pack;
    
    dealHand(Pack cards) => { Card(Ace(), Hearts()) };

    compareHands(Hand hand1, Hand hand2) => larger;
    
}
{% endhighlight %}

Although Ceylon aims at making code readable and mostly explicit, it makes an exception in the case of overriding
formal methods or properties because this is such a common case and no information is lost - if you ever see a method
that does not seem declare its return type, you know it's because you're seeing this notation and the return type is
already declared in the interface.

But beware that if you use this notation, it will be implied that the method is declared `shared actual`. If you want to
make your method definition `default`, which means that you want to allow sub-classes to refine the method definition if
desired, you would need to explicitly declare it with `shared actual default` followed by the full type signature.

> See the Ceylon Language Specification's chapter on [interfaces](http://ceylon-lang.org/documentation/1.0/spec/html/declarations.html#interfaces)
  for the full story.

### Syntax-sugar for operators by implementing interfaces

Ceylon provides some *syntax sugar* to make code more readable through the use of certain interfaces.

For example, in Part 1, we saw how the `Integer`'s methods `plus`, `minus`, `divided`, `times` and
`remainder` are equivalent to using the operators `+`, `-`, `/`, `*` and `%` respectively.

So, instead of writing `2.plus(2) == 4` we can write `2 + 2 == 4`.

The only reason why that is possible is because `Integer` satisfies the interfaces `Summable` (which
defines `plus`, or `+`), `Numeric` (which defines `minus`, `divided` and `times`, or `-`, `/` and `*`) and `Integral`
(which defines `remainder`, or `%`).

> Summable is a generic type, which means that it always appears in the form `Summable<Element>`, where `Element` is 
  a type parameter - it can be replaced with any type... or at least some allowed types, as we will see later when we
  discuss **generics**.

Anyone could write a type that satisfies `Summable`, to pick one of the interfaces mentioned above, to be able to use
the `+` operator to add together two instances of that type.

As an example, we can make a Summable kind of Iterable so that we can *add* two Iterables together:
 
> Notice that in Ceylon, normally, you cannot add two Iterables with the `+` operator. The reason why Ceylon seemingly lacks this
  functionality is that implementing `plus` for a generic Iterable would likely break the contract of `Summable`
  that requires that the `+` operation be associative.
  For example, { 1, 2 } + { 3 } would have to be the same as { 3 } + { 1, 2 }. In the definition of `SummableList` below, we
  get around that fact by adding the constraints that `SummableList` contains only `Integer`s and is always sorted, so that 
  `SummableList { 1, 2 } + SummableList { 3 } == SummableList { 3 } + SummableList { 1, 2 }`.

{% highlight ceylon %}
// necessary renaming to avoid clash with Iterable.sort in SummableList
import ceylon.language { doSort = sort }

"An always sorted Iterable containing Integers that can be summed."
class SummableList({Integer*} integers)
    satisfies Summable<SummableList> & Iterable<Integer> {
    
    {Integer*} _integers = doSort(integers);
    
    shared actual SummableList plus(SummableList other) =>
            SummableList(this._integers.chain(other._integers));
    
    shared actual Iterator<Integer> iterator() => _integers.iterator();
    
}

SummableList list1 = SummableList { 1, 2 } + SummableList { 3 };
SummableList list2 = SummableList { 3 } + SummableList { 1, 2 };
assert(list1.sequence == [1, 2, 3]);
assert(list2.sequence == [1, 2, 3]);
{% endhighlight %}

The example above, incidentally, shows how a class can declare that it satisfies more than one interface.

> A class may declare that it satisfies more than one interface by using the `&` symbol between each interface name.
  What this symbol does is similar to what `|` does for union types, but results in an intersection type. Whereas an
  instance of a union type `A|B` can be either an instance of `A` or of `B`, an instance of `A&B` is an instance of both
  `A` and `B`. That is why, in the example above, an instance of `SummableList`, which satisfies types `Summable<SummableList>`
  and `Iterable<Integer>`, can be assigned to either type.

It also shows how you can import an element and rename it to avoid name clashes (if we didn't rename `sort` to `doSort`,
it would have clashed with `Iterable`'s own `sort` method inside the definition of `SummableList`, causing a compiling error
because we are not allowed to use an inherited member in the class initializer).

One important thing to notice is that when a type satisfies an interface, besides being forced to implement all `formal`
methods and properties, it **inherits** all of its default methods.

For this reason, `SummableList` gets a large number of methods pretty much for free:

{% highlight ceylon %}
value myList = SummableList { 30, 20, 10 };
assert(myList.size == 3);
assert(exists first = myList.first, first == 10);
assert(exists last = myList.last, last == 30);
assert(exists item = myList.find((Integer elem) => elem > 10), item == 20);
assert(myList.takingWhile((Integer elem) => elem < 15).sequence == [10]);
assert(20 in myList);
{% endhighlight %}

The `in` operator maps to method `contains` of `Iterable`, so because `SummableList` satisfies `Iterable`, we can use the `in`
operator to test if a `SummableList` contains a certain element, as shown in the last example above.

If we wanted to make it possible to compare instances of `SummableList` with the comparison operators (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `<=>`),
we would have to implement the `Comparable` interface, which requires only a single method: `compare`.

If we try to compare two instances of `SummableList`, we will notice that the results will not be as expected:

{% highlight ceylon %}
// this assertion fails
assert(SummableList { 1, 2 } == SummableList { 1, 2 });
{% endhighlight %}

That's because of the way the `==` operator works. It maps to the `equals` method of the `Object` abstract class.

We will revisit the `==` operator (and also `===`, which compares *identity*) once we learn more about abstract classes,
objects and enumerated types.

## Abstract classes

Finally, the last way in which we can create a type in Ceylon is by declaring an abstract class.

> An abstract class is similar to an interface, but besides having formal and default methods and properties, it can also
  have a parameter list and hold state, like concrete classes. Unlike concrete classes, but like interfaces, abstract 
  classes may not be instantiated.

A concrete class (ie. a non-abstract class) may only extend one abstract class. This restriction does not apply to
interfaces. For this reason, it is usually preferable to use interfaces to define things unless you must hold internal
state, which you cannot do in an interface.

> In this context, *state* means having one or more fields that refer to other Objects.

On the other hand, abstract classes can still be very useful when there is some common functionality that can be implemented
appropriately for most expected implementations of a concept in the same manner. This may sound like something that is
rare in practice, but it actually happens quite often.

For example, a card game itself is a good candidate for an abstract class because any game will always have a number of
players, a dealer (which can be a player him/herself) and at least one card pack.

Let's try to express all of that in code (with the earlier definitions unaltered), using the most appropriate level of
abstraction for each element of the game:

{% highlight ceylon %}
interface Player {
    shared formal String name;
}

abstract class Game(Pack pack, Dealer dealer, Player+ players) {
    shared formal void start();
}

class MyGame(Pack pack, Dealer dealer, Player+ players)
    extends Game(pack, dealer, *players) {
    
    shared actual void start() {
        //TODO create the game
    }
}

class SimplePlayer(shared actual String name)
        satisfies Player {}

class MyGameDealer(shared actual String name) 
        extends DummyDealer()
        satisfies Player {}

shared void runGame() {
    value players = [ MyGameDealer("John"), SimplePlayer("Mark") ];
    value pack = { Card(Ace(), Spades()), Card(Ace(), Hearts()) /* ... */ };
    
    value game = MyGame(pack, players.first, *players);
    game.start();
}
{% endhighlight %}

# Objects and Enumerated types

When we defined game cards previously, we declared a lot of classes which do not have any property, they simply exist to
enumerate the possible values of a suit or a rank.

There is a better way to enumerate values like this in Ceylon using objects.

> An object is an instance of an anonymous class. Anonymous classes and objects are analogous to anonymous functions and
  lambdas, which we met in Part 1, but unlike lambdas, objects can be declared anywhere.

The following example shows the creation of some objects in their simplest form:

{% highlight ceylon %}
object someObject {}

object anotherObject {}

value referenceToSomeObject = someObject;

// like all custom types, objects extends Basic by default
print(someObject == anotherObject); // prints false
print(someObject == referenceToSomeObject); // prints true
{% endhighlight %}

Objects are useful, mostly, to represent things that can only be one... things that simply exist, like `4` or `a`, that
don't make sense to be created more than once.

In other words, we use objects when we do not want to have several instances of this thing hanging around.

That's the case, for example, with `Suit` and `Rank`, which we defined using classes earlier. Every time we write
`Hearts()` or `Four()` we are creating a new instance of `Hearts` and `Four`, respectively. Besides the
obvious waste of computer memory, this is not desirable because of the fact that `Four() == Four()`, as just one example,
will return `false`! One can even say that's a bug in our current implementation!

Armed with our knowledge about objects and interfaces, we can now refactor our definition of `Rank` to make use of them:

{% highlight ceylon %}
interface Suit {}
object spades satisfies Suit {}
object diamonds satisfies Suit {}
object hearts satisfies Suit {}
object clubs satisfies Suit {}
{% endhighlight %}

This is much better! Now, if you compare the objects, you get the expected answers:

{% highlight ceylon %}
print(spades == spades); // prints true
{% endhighlight %}

We can say that we have come a long way towards representing game cards in Ceylon in just the best possible way.

But...

You probably guessed, there's still a couple of issues with our definition!

First of all, anyone could break our game by carelessly defining a new type of `Suit`:

{% highlight ceylon %}
"Non-existing Suit"
object golds satisfies Suit {}
{% endhighlight %}

This makes it clear that we did not really enumerate ALL possible Suits in our definition. This has some other implications
we'll see later with the `switch` statement.

The thing is that it would be really, really nice if we could ensure that there's only 4 types of Suits, the 4 types that
we defined: spades, diamonds, hearts and clubs. No golds!

The second issue we still have to fix is that if you print one of our objects, `spades`, as an example, you will get
something similar to this:

```
helloCeylon.spades_@7265d075
```

That's not cool. When you print something, you should show some helpful information to the user (or the programmer
debugging the code later).

Can we fix these problems? Sure we can!

For the first problem, we can use the `of` keyword to let Ceylon know what instances of our type can exist. In other
words, to enumerate the possible values of something.

For the printing issue, there's a simple solution: overwrite the `string` property (which is defined in `Object`) for
each of our objects.

That's the secret of `print`: it knows how to print any `Object` because every `Object` has the `string` property.

Putting the two solutions together, we get this beautiful definition of a `Suit`:

{% highlight ceylon %}
interface Suit of spades | diamonds | hearts | clubs {}
object spades satisfies Suit { string => "spades"; }
object diamonds satisfies Suit { string => "diamonds"; }
object hearts satisfies Suit { string => "hearts"; }
object clubs satisfies Suit { string => "clubs"; }
{% endhighlight %}

> The syntax `string => "something";` is again the short notation for `shared actual String => "something"`.

Because we enumerated the possible values of `Suit`, it is just impossible to define any other `Suit` elsewhere.
You can't even create a class to satisfy `Suit`. Ceylon won't let you! Your class would have to be enumerated after `of`
for it to be allowed.

Notice that this *trick* works for abstract classes and classes as well, not only interfaces and objects
(but the enumerated type itself must be an abstract class or interface):

{% highlight ceylon %}
abstract class A() of B | C {}
class B() extends A() {}
class C() extends A() {}
{% endhighlight %}

By the way, the `Boolean` type itself is defined as an enumerated type:

{% highlight ceylon %}
shared abstract class Boolean() 
        of true | false {}

shared object true extends Boolean() {
    string => "true";
}

shared object false extends Boolean() {
    string => "false";
}
{% endhighlight %}

Even `null` is just the single enumerated value of the type `Null`.

## The `switch` statement

Ceylon has one more important statement which we haven't seen yet: the `switch`.

The `switch` statement allows you to select which branch to execute depending on which case is satisfied:

{% highlight ceylon %}
Boolean condition = 4 > 2;
switch(condition)
case(true) {
    print("Condition is true");
}
case (false) {
    print("Condition is false");
}
{% endhighlight %}

The cases of a switch must be exhaustive, so it is impossible to forget to cover some case (the compiler makes sure of that).

If it is not possible to enumerate all cases (because the type of the variable used in the switch has infinite values,
for example), you can add an `else` clause:

{% highlight ceylon %}
switch("abc")
case("a") {
    print("Case a");
}
case ("b") {
    print("Case b");
}
else {
    print("dunno");
}
{% endhighlight %}

Switches are very clever and can always figure out if you have covered all possible cases. Two very common use-cases
for switches are to narrow the type of a value and to find out which of the enumerated types a value might have:

{% highlight ceylon %}
void show(Integer|Float|Boolean|String item) {
    switch(item)
    case (is Integer) {
        // here item has type Integer
        print("Integer ``item + 0``");
    }
    case (is Float) {
        print("Float ``item``");

        return "Diamonds";

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism is one of the most powerful concepts in programming. You may read a formal definition of polymorphism on
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_\(computer_science\)) if you are interested, but in this tutorial
we'll concern ourselves only with the practical uses of polymorphism.

The idea is really simple: you should be able to manipulate different things in the same way if they can be seen as being
conceptually the same, even if only in certain contexts.
 
In practice, this means one of two things in Ceylon: sub-typing and generics.

### Sub-typing

We have already met sub-typing a few times. Every time we satisfy an interface `A` in a class `B`, `B` becomes a subtype
of `A`. It works the same way when a class `X` extends class `Y`: `X` becomes a subtype of `Y` (and `Y` a super-type
of `X`).

Most of the time, a subtype can be seen, and treated, in the exact same way as its super-type(s). This becomes obvious
when you consider that a subtype inherits all the behavior of its super-type(s).

Let's look at a concrete example. We mentioned earlier that all custom types, by default, extend `Basic`.

Effectively, writing `class A() {}` is equivalent to writing `class A() extends Basic() {}`.

> You can open any type declaration in the IDE by hitting Ctrl+Shift+T and entering the name of a type.
  Have a look at the definitions of `Basic` and `Object`! With a type opened, hit Ctrl+T to see the type hierarchy.


![Ceylon type hierarchy](/images/ceylon_type_hierarchy.png)


`Basic` does not define any property or method, but it extends `Object` and satisfies `Identifiable`.

`Object` has one formal method, `equals`, one formal property, `hash`, and provides a default implementation of `string`:

{% highlight ceylon %}
shared formal Boolean equals(Object that);

shared formal Integer hash;
    
shared default String string =>
        className(this) + "@" + hash.string;
{% endhighlight %}

The reason why custom types are not required to provide implementation for anything is that `Identifiable`, which is
satisfied by `Basic`, provides default implementations for both `equals` and `hash`. This is really convenient, because
`equals`, as we already saw, maps to the `==` operator, so that you can use the `==` operator with any custom type.

The `===` operator (notice it's 3 `=`) is used to determine if two values are references to the same instance.
It can be used with any type that satisfies `Identifiable`, and the default implementation of `equals` just delegates
to `===`:

{% highlight ceylon %}
shared default actual Boolean equals(Object that) {
    if (is Identifiable that) {
        return this === that;
    }
    else {
        return false;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now it should be obvious why we had an unexpected result when we tried to use the `==` operator to compare two instances
of `SummableList` earlier on!

It is important to understand that just because you don't need to implement `equals`, it doesn't mean that you shouldn't!
In fact, you are encouraged to implement it for most types.

Just for completeness, let's finally fix `SummableList` and make sure it respects the contract of `Summable`:

{% highlight ceylon %}
class SummableList({Integer*} integers)
    satisfies Summable<SummableList> & Iterable<Integer> {
    
    {Integer*} _integers = doSort(integers);
    
    plus(SummableList other) =>
        SummableList(this._integers.chain(other._integers));
    
    iterator() => _integers.iterator();
    
    hash => _integers.hash;
    
    shared actual Boolean equals(Object other) {
        if (is SummableList other) {
            return this.sequence == other.sequence;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
}
{% endhighlight %}

> Besides implementing `equals`, notice that we also implemented `hash`. That's always a good idea because to respect
  the contract of `Object`, which states that *if `x == y` then `x.hash == y.hash`*, when you implement `equals` you must always
  implement `hash` as well. This is particularly important if your type may be added to a `HashSet` or a `HashMap`.

  [Chapter 3](http://ceylon-lang.org/documentation/1.0/spec/html/typesystem.html).


### Generics

You may not have known it, but you have already seen generic types before! In fact, all list types we saw before are
generic, ie. they may contain items of any type (actually, the types may be bounded, as we'll see).

{% highlight ceylon %}
Sequence<Integer> list1 = [1, 2, 3];
Iterable<String|Boolean> list2 = {"Hi", true, false, "Bye"};
{% endhighlight %}

`Sequence<Integer>` is a Sequence which can only hold Integers.
`Iterable<String|Boolean>` is an Iterable which can only hold Strings or Booleans.

The type between the angle brackets (`< >`) is a type parameter for the generic type.

Before we explain this in more detail, let's create a generic type to see how that's done!
 
You might remember that earlier, we defined a type called `SummableList` that satisfied `Iterable<Integer>`... there's
no reason why this type should be usable only to hold Integers! As Iterable itself, we should allow it to hold values
of any type.

Here's a new definition of `SummableList` that fixes that problem using generics:

{% highlight ceylon %}
class SummableList<Element>({Element*} elements)
    satisfies Summable<SummableList<Element>> & Iterable<Element> {
    
    //FIXME these elements should be sorted! We must fix this later.
    {Element*} _elements = elements; // doSort(elements);
    
    plus(SummableList<Element> other) =>
        SummableList(this._elements.chain(other._elements));
    
    iterator() => _elements.iterator();
    
    hash => _elements.hash;
    
    shared actual Boolean equals(Object other) {
        if (is SummableList<Element> other) {
            return this.sequence == other.sequence;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
}
{% endhighlight %}

> The type `Element` above is not an actual type, it is only a type parameter which will be "replaced" with a concrete
  type when an actual instance of SummableList is created.

> You can see in this code sample one of the techniques programmers often use during development: to add comments that
  start with `FIXME` to describe temporary solutions that need fixing later (but won't affect the development
  of other parts of the system for some time) or `TODO` for things that need to be done, but cannot be done now for
  whatever reason. These are easily searchable (in the IDE, open `Window > Show View > Tasks` to see all your TODOs) so
  you can get back to them later. But not everyone likes that as it might encourage sloppy behavior if abused. It's not
  uncommon to see hundreds of TODOs on large code bases that will probably go unnoticed for years, if not forever. You
  are warned, this can be useful, but use with care!


We can then use our new SummableList type as follows:

{% highlight ceylon %}
// normally, the type parameter is inferred
value stringList1 = SummableList { "ABC", "XYZ" };
value integerList1 = SummableList { 1, 2, 3 };

// but you can tell Ceylon what type it should be!
value stringList2 = SummableList<String> { "ABC", "XYZ" };
value integerList2 = SummableList<Integer> { 1, 2, 3 };
{% endhighlight %}

If you explicitly declare the type parameter as in the second example above, then all elements of the SummableList must
be a subtype of that type.

Now, imagine if `Iterable` were not generic. It would be really painful to use! To access any element, it would be necessary
to "narrow" its type (with `if` or `assert`) before trying to use it. And there would be no guarantee that the Iterable
would not contain values of unexpected types, giving bugs a plentiful environment to prosper (this may all sound crazy,
but in the dark days of computing - ie. 10 years ago or so - programming without generics was actually common-place and
enabled by, among other sloppy techniques, [type casting](http://howtoprogramwithjava.com/java-cast/) -
or guessing the type - which Ceylon wisely does not even allow).

But there was a problem in the above implementation of SummableList (the one marked with `FIXME`). We no longer ensured
that elements of the list were sorted. That was necessary for the current implementation of SummableList to compile for
one simple reason: the `sort` function, that we use to sort the elements of the list, is a generic function!

That's right, functions can also be generic! Take a look at the type signature of `sort`:

{% highlight ceylon %}
shared Element[] sort<Element>({Element*} elements) 
        given Element satisfies Comparable<Element> => ...
{% endhighlight %}

Ok, so it takes an Iterable of some type `Element` and returns a Sequential of the same type. So far so good, but you are
probably wondering now what exactly is this `given Element satisfies ...` thing!

That's actually really simple: `given` tells us (and Ceylon) that Element can be any type **as long as**
(or **given that**) this type satisfies `Comparable<Element>`. In other words, we make the upper bound of our type
parameter be `Comparable<Element>`.

This is necessary for any sort function to work because to be able to sort a list, you must be able to compare
an element to another... and any subtype of `Comparable<Element>` will have to implement the `compare` method, which
guarantees to us that we can compare a value of this type with any other value of the same type!

Finally, we can address the `FIXME` in the previous implementation of `SummableList`. We could not use the `sort` function
before because we did not restrict the type of the elements of SummableList, so there was no way to compare them to sort
them. Now we can do exactly that and solve the problem:

{% highlight ceylon %}
import ceylon.language { doSort = sort }

class SummableList<Element>({Element*} elements)
        satisfies Summable<SummableList<Element>> & Iterable<Element>
        given Element satisfies Comparable<Element> {
    
    {Element*} _elements = doSort(elements);
    
    plus(SummableList<Element> other) =>
        SummableList(this._elements.chain(other._elements));
    
    iterator() => _elements.iterator();
    
    hash => _elements.hash;
    
    shared actual Boolean equals(Object other) {
        if (is SummableList<Element> other) {
            return this.sequence == other.sequence;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
}
{% endhighlight %}

To make our types as re-usable as possible, we should try to restrict their type parameters with the most generic type
(or highest bound) possible.

Making Element's upper bound be `Comparable<Element>` is much better than, say, making it `Scalar` (which is a subtype
of Comparable) because all functionality we require from our elements is provided by the higher bound, `Comparable<Element>`.
Many programmers overlook this fact and needlessly restrict too much the types their functions and types can work with.
The same is true also for arguments - they should always be of the most generic type for the code to do what it needs to
do.

Often, you will have to make `Object` your type's upper bound because if you do not do that, you will
have to make sure your generic type or function also works with `Null` values.

Just like value parameters, there can be many type parameters and each one can be given a default value.

{% highlight ceylon %}
class TwoOrThreeThings<A, B, C = Null>(
    shared A a, shared B b, shared C c) {}

// the third type parameter defaults to Null
void printTwoThings(TwoOrThreeThings<String, Boolean> twoThings) {
    print("String is ``twoThings.a`` and Boolean is ``twoThings.b``");
}

// the third parameter is bound to Integer
void printThreeThings(TwoOrThreeThings<String, Boolean, Integer> threeThings) {
    print("* String is ``threeThings.a``
           * Boolean is ``threeThings.b``
           * Integer is ``threeThings.c``");
}

printTwoThings(TwoOrThreeThings("Hi", true, null));
printThreeThings(TwoOrThreeThings("Hi", true, 20));
{% endhighlight %}


### Covariant and contravariant type parameters

Type parameters can be declared in 3 different ways:

* **invariant**: as all the type parameters we have met above.
* **covariant**: parameters declared with `out`, as in `Iterable<out Element>`.
* **contravariant**: parameters declared with `in`, as in `ListMutator<in Element>`.

If a type parameter in **invariant**, like the `SummableList` we have created, then a `SummableList<SimplePlayer>`, for
example, is NOT a subtype of `SummableList<Player>` (even though it seems logical it should be, because `SimplePlayer`
is a subtype of `Player`). Because of that, the following code will not compile:

{% highlight ceylon %}
void playGame(SummableList<Player> players) {
    //TODO
}

SummableList<SimplePlayer> players = SummableList { SimplePlayer("Anna") };

// does not compile!
playGame(players);
{% endhighlight %}

If a type parameter is **covariant**, as the type parameter of `Iterable`, then an `Iterable<SimplePlayer>`, for example,
will be a subtype of `Iterable<Player>` because `SimplePlayer` is a subtype of `Player`, so the above code sample will
compile if we substitute SummableList with Iterable:

{% highlight ceylon %}
void playGame({Player*} players) {
    //TODO
}

Iterable<SimplePlayer> players = { SimplePlayer("Anna") };

playGame(players);
{% endhighlight %}

Contravariant type parameters can be seen as the opposite of covariant type parameters.

If B is a subtype of A, and there is a type T with a covariant type parameter, then `T<B>` is a subtype of
`T<A>`, as we've seen above.

If T has a contravariant type parameter instead, then `T<B>` is a supertype of `T<A>`, not a subtype of it! 

Another way of looking at it is to think of a type with a covariant type parameter `E` as a *producer* of `E`, and of a
type with a contravariant type parameter `E` as a *consumer* of `E`.

Think about it, you can get instances of `E` from a non-empty `Iterable<E>` (by using the property `first` for example).
In a way, you can get `E`s *out* of an `Iterable<E>` (that's basically why in Ceylon we use the word `out` to indicate
covariance).

Examples of types with contravariant type parameters are usually mutable data structures (we'll meet them in the next
section) which allow adding elements *in*
or just use the elements to provide some service. These types can be seen as *consumers* of `E`. We can pass `E`s *in* to
them, explaining why `in` is used for contravariant type parameters.

There is a very good discussion of [covariant and contravariant](http://ceylon-lang.org/documentation/1.0/tour/generics/)
type parameters in the Tour of Ceylon, so have a look at it if you want to know more details. For those of you who are
interested in the low-level details, this [blog post](http://ceylon-lang.org/blog/2013/11/17/intersections-and-variance/)
by Gavin King (creator of Ceylon) might be of interest.

## Mutability and data structures that can change

Most languages take mutability, or the ability to change values and state, for granted.
For example, the following is perfectly valid in Java:

{% highlight java %}
// Java code
String fruit = "apple";
fruit = "orange";
fruit = "banana";
{% endhighlight %}

In Ceylon, you wouldn't normally be able to do that:

{% highlight ceylon %}
String fruit = "apple";
fruit = "orange"; // DOES NOT COMPILE
fruit = "banana"; // DOES NOT COMPILE
{% endhighlight %}

Once you've assigned the value `"apple"` to the identifier `fruit`, you cannot change your mind and
say it's an `"orange"` or a `"banana"` instead.

You can also do the following to change the contents of a list (or array, in this case) in most languages:

{% highlight java %}
// Java code
String[] fruits = { "apple", "orange", "banana" };

// change some fruits
fruits[1] = "pear";
fruits[2] = "pineapple";

// comparing two arrays in Java. Enable assertions with the -ea JVM argument
assert(Arrays.equals(fruits, new String[] { "apple", "pear", "pineapple" }));
{% endhighlight %}

In Ceylon, you cannot do this using the familiar Iterable and Sequential (you would need to use the Array class,
as we'll see).

Avoiding mutability makes it much easier to reason about the code. You do
not need to consider the possibility that any of your values might be modified at any time, almost anywhere in the code
base where that data is visible (though scoping alleviates some of this, it cannot solve the problem completely),
and that the timing of these changes can be hard to manage, which can potentially cause many bugs.

There are also other considerations that make mutability something you should be careful with, such as visibility across
[different threads](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_safety), which we are not yet ready to discuss as we have not
met Threads before, that make parallel programming incredibly harder!

Some languages (pure functional languages, notably Haskell) simply do not allow things to be changed at all
(but it is still possible to write fully functioning programs in them, though sometimes inconvenient).

Ceylon, on the other hand, does allow changes, or mutability, because there are certain cases which make it
quite impractical (or just very inefficient) for the programmer to not be able to change things
(we'll see later how it will be convenient to allow a `Pack` of cards to change during a game, for example).
It is just not the "default" way of doing things because it is understood these days that the cost of unrestricted
mutability is too high to compensate for the apparent convenience it provides.

Let's see how mutability is supported in Ceylon.

For example, if you really want to change the value of your fruit as the program runs, you can annotate `fruit`
with the `variable` annotation:

> An annotation in Ceylon is just a special kind of function that allows extra metadata to be provided and
  used at runtime to modify the behavior of the program. We have already met some annotations:
  `shared`, `formal`, `default`, `actual`, `abstract`, and now, `variable`, are all annotations. 
  As usual, this is explained in detail in the [Tour](http://ceylon-lang.org/documentation/1.0/tour/annotations/).

{% highlight ceylon %}
variable String fruit = "apple";
fruit = "orange"; // OK!
fruit = "banana"; // OK!
{% endhighlight %}

Iterables and Sequences are not modifiable (we call them immutable), so you cannot do as in the Java example and change
which elements they contain after they've been created... but Ceylon does provide mutable (ie. modifiable)
data structures such as the simple `Array` in the language module, and `LinkedList`, `HashMap` and `HashSet`
in the `ceylon.collection` module (more collections will be added in Ceylon 1.1).

Using `Array`in Ceylon:

{% highlight ceylon %}
value fruits = Array { "apple", "orange", "banana" };

// change item at index 1 to "pear"
fruits.set(1, "pear");

// change item at index 2 to "pineapple"
fruits.set(2, "pineapple");

assert(fruits == ["apple", "pear", "pineapple"]);
{% endhighlight %}

Arrays are (probably) not used very often in Ceylon because even though you can change them, you cannot add or remove
items to make them grow or shrink in size. For that, you can use an LinkedList, for example, from the `ceylon.collection`
module.

To use the collection module, you need to import it in your `module.ceylon` file:

{% highlight ceylon %}
module hello.ceylonn "1.0.0" {
    import ceylon.collection "1.0.0";
}
{% endhighlight %}

> Ceylon provides a large number of modules ready to be used out-of-the-box, just enter a new line below the first
  import in `module.ceylon`, type `import ceylon` and hit `Ctrl+Space` to see what else you can import!
  The complete list of Ceylon modules, including also third-party modules, can be seen in the
  [Ceylon Herd](https://modules.ceylon-lang.org/), which is the Ceylon module repository. Any module from Herd can be
  imported as shown above: just add the appropriate import in you module file and it will be automatically downloaded.

You are now able to import anything provided by the collection module, such as a `LinkedList`:

{% highlight ceylon %}
import ceylon.collection { LinkedList }

value fruits = LinkedList { "apple", "orange", "banana" };
fruits.set(1, "pear");
fruits.set(2, "pineapple");

// we can also add some fruit
fruits.add("persimon");
fruits.add("fig");

// ... and remove a fruit
fruits.removeElement("pineapple");

assert(fruits == ["apple", "pear", "persimon", "fig"]);
{% endhighlight %}

`HashSet` is a data structure that can be used to store unique entries efficiently (as in maths, sets cannot contain
duplicates). They use the hash code of the items (as we've seen before, all `Object` subtypes have a `hash`
property) they store to make items lookup faster. If you want to avoid having more than one `"apple"` or `"orange"` in
your fruits collection, for example, just use a `HashSet` and it will take care of that for you.

> As noticed earlier, it is a very good idea to refine the `equals` and `hash` methods in each type you expect to store
  in HashSets or as keys for HashMaps. Also, never store mutable objects in a `HashSet` or `HashMap` because if the `hash`
  of the object changes after it is added to the container, it will almost certainly become irretrievable!

`HashMap` can map keys to values and is widely used as a in-memory data storage. We can, for example, use a HashMap to
keep the score of each Player in a game:

{% highlight ceylon %}
value player1 = SimplePlayer("Anna");
value player2 = SimplePlayer("John");

value scoreByPlayer = HashMap { player1 -> 10, player2 -> 5 };

value player1Score = scoreByPlayer[player1] else 0;
value player2Score = scoreByPlayer[player2] else 0;

value winner = (player1Score > player2Score) then player1 else player2;

print("``winner.name`` wins!");
{% endhighlight %}

The syntax `player1 -> 10` creates an instance of `Entry<SimplePlayer, Integer>`, or, equivalently, `SimplePlayer -> Integer`.
Entries are a convenient way to build maps, as shown above.

Accessing items of the map can be done using square brackets, as shown above, or equivalently, using the `get` method:

{% highlight ceylon %}
Integer? player1Score = scoreByPlayer.get(player1);
{% endhighlight %}

We usually use `else defaultValue` when trying to access values of Maps because `get` returns either the value associated
with the key, or `null` if no value exists for that key
(notice that values of a Map are restricted to subtypes of Object so you cannot add `null` as a value in a Map,
ensuring that `null` really represents the absence of a value).

## Practice time

In the next section, we will focus less on theory and more on practice, and try to implement a fully functional cards
game using all the knowledge we have gained through Parts 1 and 2. You should be able to do it yourself by now anyway,
so [let me know](<mailto:renato@athaydes.com>) if you have and I will add a link to your project below!

Stay tuned for Part 3... it's coming soon!
