title: Learn Programming in Ceylon - Part 1
---


## Introduction

Programming is one of the most rewarding activities there is. Once you master it, you will be able to create all sorts of
things. Every single app, or program, you ever used on a computer was created mostly by computer programmers.

Every game you've ever played, every animation you've watched on the Internet, every website you've visited, required
someone (or many people) to write computer instructions that specify in minute detail how everything should look, behave,
change, react. It may look like an incredibly daunting task, and it is! But it is also one of the most fun tasks you can imagine!
With only a computer, some free software and, most importantly, a good knowledge of programming, you can create anything
that you are able to envision. There are no limits!

And the best thing is that not only is programming a lot of fun, learning it means you will have no trouble getting a job
anytime soon. And with a pretty good paycheck too, just about anywhere on the planet.

This tutorial is mostly for people with little or no experience in programming. It may also be useful for experienced programmers
who want to learn new concepts using one of the newest programming languages around - Ceylon.

Learning Ceylon is certainly a very good way to be introduced to programming because it contains, in a package that is
much more consistent than most alternative languages, all features you would expect of a very modern language (Ceylon 1.0 was
released in the end of 2013). By learning Ceylon, you will be able to easily understand and pick up many other similar
programming languages.

But before we get started with writing code, a little bit of history to give some context.

## A short history of programming languages

These days, very few people work on the processor-instructions level, which is done in a kind of language called
 [Assembly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language).

That's because to achieve anything much useful in Assembly would require enormous amounts of effort. Assembly was designed
to map directly to machine instructions. Basically, it is a machine-friendly language, not a human-friendly one.

Luckily, people have created many higher level languages overtime that made it easier for humans to write code that can
later be translated to Assembly by other programs, which can then be executed by computers. Programs that do the translation are called
**compilers** or **interpreters**.

One of the first such higher level languages was [Fortran](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran), created in the early 1950's.
Many other languages followed, a few noticeable examples being LISP (1958), COBOL (1959), C (1969) and Prolog (1972).

In recent years, there has been an explosion on the number of programming languages freely available to anyone willing to
learn them, some of which even "compile" to other languages! The number is almost certainly in the thousands, though it is
hard to know how many languages are actually used by more than just a few people.

The big, dominant languages, on the other hand, are currently just a few: Java, C++, C#, Python, JavaScript, besides LISP
(under a few varieties) are probably the main ones.

Newer languages incorporate lessons learned in previous generations of languages to make programming easier and more efficient.
And a lot of lessons have been learned in the half-century people have been using higher level languages.

The newest generation of languages, which includes beautiful languages such as Haskell and D, are still coming up with innovations
to attempt to improve on their predecessors and find the perfect balance between simplicity and expressivity, speed and
conciseness.

To get the balance right is very difficult. But out of the newest wave of languages, one stands out for having an incredibly
powerful and disciplined, yet simple and accessible character: the [Ceylon programming language](http://ceylon-lang.org/).

## What is Ceylon

Ceylon is a direct [descendant of Java](http://ceylon-lang.org/documentation/1.0/faq/#what_is_ceylon),
which is a language that has been battle-tested in all sorts of conditions (in small and very large applications) and despite
its shortcomings, proven to be a great tool for developing almost any sort of application. Ceylon improves on Java's foundations
by keeping what's good, removing what's not so good, and adding some nice new concepts and lessons learned from many other
languages, packaging everything into a highly concise unit which really makes programming a pleasurable experience.

Amongst the [many goals](http://ceylon-lang.org/blog/2012/01/10/goals/) of Ceylon, to achieve high readability and
predictability are clearly the top ones. These are extremely important things in programming. When you read some code,
you should be able to immediately know what it is trying to achieve, even if you are not familiar with all the details of the software.
With Ceylon, that can be closer to reality than with just about any other language (but programmer's diligence still accounts for most
of the quality of the software, in Ceylon and in any other language).

Ceylon was designed from scratch to work in at least 2 different platforms:

* JVM (Java Virtual Machine) - the Java runtime.
* JavaScript engines - which includes basically every Internet browser and [node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

This is really cool because it means you can write code that runs wherever you need it to run without changes!

To get started with Ceylon, the easiest way is to use the [Ceylon IDE](http://ceylon-lang.org/documentation/1.0/ide/install/)
(Integrated Development Environment, or in plain English, the software you use to easily write  and run Ceylon programs,
which lots of nice features like auto-completion - it suggests to you what kinds of things you can do while you write something -,
syntax highlighting and many other things).

## Installing the Ceylon IDE

The first step to get the Ceylon IDE is to download Eclipse (Standard), which is the general system the Ceylon IDE is based on. Go to [this page](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/), choose the correct version for your system, then unzip the file you've downloaded into an easy to find directory, such as `/programming/eclipse/`.

Inside the `eclipse` folder, you will find the Eclipse executable. Double-click on it to start Eclipse (and add a shortcut to it on your desktop so you can find it easily next time!). Eclipse will suggest a workspace location the first time you open it. An Eclipse workspace is just a place for Eclipse to save your projects and other information it needs to work. Just accept the default (or choose any other location you want) and click OK.

Finally, you should see the Eclipse Welcome Page:

![Eclipse Welcome Page](https://www.sugarsync.com/pf/D6255314_638_6794803818?directDownload=true)

The overview and tutorials Eclipse comes with are targeted mostly at Java developers, but feel free to have a look at some of it if you have some time... but if you just want to get your hands dirty with Ceylon, just ignore those and keep reading!

To install the Ceylon plugin into Eclipse, follow these steps:

1. In the top menu bar, click on the `Help` menu item then select `Install new software...`.
2. In the `Work with` field, enter this URL:  `http://ceylon-lang.org/eclipse/updatesite/`
3. Click on the `Add...` button. A popup will come up, but you can just hit OK again (you don't need to give the site a name, just leave the Name field blank).
4. You should now select all options, as shown below, and click on OK.

![Install Ceylon in Eclipse](http://ceylon-lang.org/images/eclipseupdatesite.png)

5. Click on `Next` a few times, accept the license agreement and finally hit `Finish`!

> At this stage you might see a Warning message saying that this software contains unsigned content. That's fine, you've just downloaded the files from ceylon-lang.org, so there's nothing to fear, you can trust the good [Ceylon people](http://ceylon-lang.org/community/team/)! Click on OK and continue with the installation.

6. Click on OK to restart Eclipse.

If everything went ok, you should now see a nice elephant (the Ceylon mascot) next to a `Ceylon IDE` button. Click on this button and then on the `New Project` link. Give your project any name you want and follow the prompts.

And that's it! We're ready to start coding in Ceylon!

## Creating a Ceylon module

To create a program using Ceylon, we must create a module, which is the top-level unit of any Ceylon library or application.

Click on `File`, select `New` and then `Ceylon Module`. Enter a module name, such as `helloCeylon`, and click on `Finish`.

> Notice that Ceylon Module names can only contain alpha-numeric characters (and `_`) and must not start with a number or capital-letter.
 The same limitation applies to function and variable names (soon you will see what these words mean).
 Also notice that every Ceylon module has a version! This is an awesome feature that Ceylon, unlike most languages,
 has built into the language itself and which makes Ceylon code highly modular, but that's a little bit of an advanced topic for now!

You should now have a project with the following contents:

<code>source/</code><br/>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;|--helloCeylon/</code><br/>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|--module.ceylon</code><br/>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|--package.ceylon</code><br/>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|--run.ceylon</code><br/>

The module descriptor can be used to document the module's functionality, its version, and to import other modules.

*module.ceylon*
{% highlight ceylon %}
"This is our first Ceylon module!"
module helloCeylon "1.0.0" {
    // import other modules here
}
{% endhighlight %}


A module can have one or more packages. Each package can contain several elements such as functions, classes, objects
and interfaces (we will look at each one of them in detail later on).

Packages are directories under (and including) the module directory and must have the same name as the directory.
In this example, our first package is called `helloCeylon`. If we create a directory under it called `myPackage`,
this directory will be the `helloCeylon.myPackage` package.

Each package may contain a package descriptor called `package.ceylon`. This file is used to document the package and to
make it `shared`, if desired.

If the package is `shared`, all elements defined in this package that are also `shared` will be visible in other modules
that import this module.

*package.ceylon*
{% highlight ceylon %}
"Package for our initial program."
shared package helloCeylon;
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, you should also have a source file called `run.ceylon` inside the `helloCeylon` package with the following contents:

*run.ceylon*
{% highlight ceylon %}
"Run the module `helloCeylon`."
shared void run() {
    
}
{% endhighlight %}

This is where we are going to write the source code, which defines the actual functionality of our programs.
The name of the file does not matter much and you can have many source files in each package 
(source files must have the `.ceylon` extension).

The initial function's name, which for the above code is `run`, also does not matter, but it's a Ceylon
convention to call the main function, ie. the function that starts your program, `run`.

A few words have now been introduced and deserve an explanation! First of all, a `function` is
just a piece of code which can be executed by either other functions or by the Ceylon runtime.
`function`s are one of the most important blocks from which you will create whole applications
(but not the only one, we will learn about many others later, such as `class`, `interface` etc).

As already mentioned, `run` is the name of the function... `shared` just means that this function
should be "visible" to elements that are located in different packages and, possibly, modules.

`void` means that the function does not return anything back to the caller. Other functions might return things, like a
`Number`, but let's keep it simple at first!

## Hello World!

We can make Ceylon write something out (`print` in programmer's jargon) by changing the contents of `run.ceylon` to this:

{% highlight ceylon %}
"Run the module `helloCeylon`."
shared void run() {
    print("Hello World!");    
}
{% endhighlight %}

This is the famous Hello World program, which is almost always the first program you write when learning a programming language!
As you can see, it's pretty simple in Ceylon! We invoke another function called `print`, which Ceylon provides to us, with
an argument `"Hello World!"`. We must use quotes so that Ceylon understands that we want it to treat `Hello World!` as plain text, not some
kind of function call or anything else. We need to add a `;` at the end to indicate that our statement is complete (like the `.` in
the end of this sentence). You could write more than one statement in one line:

{% highlight ceylon %}
print("Hello"); print("Hi there"); print("I said hi!");
{% endhighlight %}

But this makes it harder to understand the code, so it is almost always better to have only one statement per line.

But now, let's get to the real fun and run our first program! 

Click on the green play button on the top of the screen. In the bottom pane called `Console` (should be near the bottom-right
 of the screen), you should see the message we asked to be printed, `Hello World!`.

You can change the text in the `String` (text between quotes) to anything you like! Well, almost anything...

Ceylon allows you to include `value`s, in a String. But to do that, we must first understand what a value is.

## Types and values

Plain text like `"Hello World!"` is referred to as a `String` in the programming world (not only in Ceylon).
There are many other **types**, as these things are called, that you can use. For example:

* `Integer`: integers such as `-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 ...`. Hexa-decimal numbers can also be represented: `#FF05DA`,
which is `16713178` in decimal, and metric symbols can be used: `10K` or `10_000`, `2M` or `2_000_000`
* `Float`: floating-point numbers like `-2.0, -1.95, 2.0, 12_345.678`, `1m` or `0.001`, `34u` or `0.000_034`
* `Boolean`: either the value `true` or `false`, one of the most useful types in any program!
* `Char`: characters (Unicode) like ` 'a', 'b', 'A', 'z', '\\{#03C0}' ` (the last of which is the beloved constant `pi`!)
* `Null`: a type with only one possible value, `null` (meaning the absence of any value, something that comes in handy quite often)

As you can see, type names always start with a capital-letter so that it's easy to differentiate between a type and a value
identifier, which must always start with a lower-case letter or `_`.

Everything (values, objects, functions) has a type. The type of a value defines what can be done with that value. For example,
if you have a value whose type is `Integer`, you immediately know that you can:

* get its successor: `1.successor == 2`
* get its predecessor: `10.predecessor == 9`
* know whether it is a positive Integer: `(-3).positive == false`
* get a `String` representation of it: `0.string == "0"`
* use mathematical operators on it: `2 + 2 == 4`, `4 ^ 2 == 16`
* many other things! Type a number followed by a `.` to see what else you can do with it.

> You may notice that Integers and Floats contain several methods that are equivalent to mathematical operations, such as
  `plus`, `minus`, `divided`, `remainder`, `times`... which are equivalent to `+`, `-`, `/`, `%`, `*` respectively. That's
  because when you write `2 + 2`, Ceylon actually interprets this as `2.plus(2)`, which you can also write if you prefer.
  Later we will see how this allows anyone to create types that can be used with those operators.

We can also define our own types, but we will have to learn a few more things before we do that!

The following code illustrates how we can declare a value called `name` with contents `"John"`
(in other words, a `String` of value `"John"`):

{% highlight ceylon %}
value name = "John";
{% endhighlight %}

This is equivalent to writing `String name = "John"`, but Ceylon already knows that `"John"` must be a String, so you
usually don't need to tell it that (unless the value is declared at package-level, or outside any function)!

`value` is a Ceylon keyword, and as such, you must not name something in your program `value`. There's quite a few reserved
[keywords](http://ceylon-lang.org/documentation/1.0/spec/html/lexical.html#identifiersandkeywords) in Ceylon
(which are necessary for it to be able to interpret your programs)... for example, a few of them are `void`,
`if`, `then`, `else`, `for`, `while` and `in`, which are instructions we will get back to shortly...

> If you really must name something with a keyword, you can scape it with \\i, for example: `value \\ivalue = "Hi"`.

Now, instead of just printing a fixed String, let's make Ceylon print a String containing our value (paste the following
code inside the `run` function):

{% highlight ceylon %}
value name = "John";
print("Hello ``name``!");
{% endhighlight %}

If you run this program, you should see the message `Hello John!`! By wrapping `name` between back-quotes ``` `` ```,
we made Ceylon interpret `name` as not plain text, but as an arbitrary Ceylon expression.

You may be asking yourself: but why not just write `print("Hello John!");`? and that would actually be exactly the same thing
for this basic example... but let's now change our program slightly to ask the person running the program to enter a value,
then print *Hello* to the name given:

{% highlight ceylon %}
value name = process.readLine();
print("Hello ``name``!");
{% endhighlight %}

> `process` is an `object` that is always available in Ceylon... to see what other things it can do, just type `process.`
  in the IDE and wait for the IDE to show you (hitting Ctrl+Space will bring a popup with suggestions from anywhere!).

Now, when you run this program, you will notice it will not print anything until you actually type something into the console
window and hit Enter. But after you do that, you should see our greeting message printed with whatever value you entered.

This is really awesome, isn't it?

## Implementing a Maths Helper

How about a program that does maths for us?

That's pretty simple, here are some examples:

{% highlight ceylon %}
value x = 2 + 2;
value y = 123 * 456;
print("x is ``x`` and y is ``y``");
{% endhighlight %}

Which prints:

```
x is 4 and y is 56088
```

You could even ask the user to enter numbers to use in the calculation:

{% highlight ceylon %}
process.write("Enter a number (x): ");
value userX = process.readLine();
value x = parseFloat(userX);
process.write("Enter a number (y): ");
value userY = process.readLine();
value y = parseFloat(userY);

if (exists x, exists y) {
    print("``x`` * ``y`` = ``x * y``");
} else {
    print("You must enter numbers!");
}
{% endhighlight %}

> Most of the syntax used above will be explained in the next section. For now, it should be enough to know that when you
  ask the user for a number, the user may enter invalid input, so you must check that `x` and `y` actually `exists` before
  trying to use them in any operation.

The `write` method of `process` prints something to the console, just like `print`, but it does not create a new line
after printing (unlike `print`, which is really just short for `process.writeLine`).

If you run this program, then enter `3` for `x` and `5` for `y`, the program should print:

```
3.0 * 5.0 = 15.0
```

Neat! Now you will never have to do multiplication in your calculator again!

Actually you could have used many other mathematical operators: `+` (plus), `-` (minus), `/` (division),
`%` (remainder), `^` (exponential)... you can use Ceylon as a powerful calculator:

{% highlight ceylon %}
print(((2.5 * 3.0) ^ 2) + ((10_000 / 7)  % 37));
{% endhighlight %}

## The `if` statement and boolean expressions

In the previous section, we made use of another Ceylon function, `parseFloat`, to turn the `String` the user entered with
the keyboard into a `Float` (ie. a floating-point number) so that we can actually multiply the numbers.

But notice that after we get values for `x` and `y`, there is an interesting new construct:

{% highlight ceylon %}
if (exists x, exists y) { ... } else { ... }
{% endhighlight %}

What this does is: first it checks if `x` exists... that's necessary because the user might have entered something that's
not a number for `x`, in which case the function `parseFloat` would not have been able to return a `Float` number at all!
But if `x` exists, it then checks if `y` also exists... only if that's the case, the code between the braces will be executed.

If either `x` or `y` did not exist (ie. could not be understood as a number), Ceylon will execute the code in the `else`
clause and print `You must enter numbers!`.

> You might be thinking, if the function `parseFloat` does not return a `Float` when we type something like `NOT A NUMBER!!!`
as a value for `x`, what does it return??? The answer is the object called `null`, of which you will hear a lot later! For
now, it's enough to say that `parseFloat` gives us either a `Float` or `null`, and because we cannot multiply something with
`null`, we must make sure that what we have is not `null` (which is what `exists` does), which means it can only be a `Float`.

You can try using `if` with any *boolean* expression (something that evaluates to either `true` or `false`).
A boolean expression usually contains one or more of the comparison or logical operators:

* `==`       - equals
* `!=`       - not equals
* `>`        - greater than
* `>=`       - greater than or equal to
* `<`        - less than
* `<=`       - less than or equal to
* `&&`       - logical AND
* `||`       - logical OR
* `!`        - logical NOT

> If you don't know much about logic, that's fine. All you need to know for now is that an AND condition is true if and
  only if both operands are true. An OR condition is true if and only if one or more of its operands are true.

The following keywords can also be part of a boolean expression (don't worry if you don't know what `null` or `Iterable` mean,
they will be explained shortly):

* `exists`   - checks something is not `null`
* `nonempty` - checks an Iterable is contains at least one element
* `in`       - checks an element is present in an Iterable
* `is`       - checks a value is an instance of some type

For example:

{% highlight ceylon %}
if (5 > 0) {
    print("Ceylon knows that 5 is greater than 0!");
}

value x = 10;
value y = 20;

if (x <= 0) {
    print("This will be printed if x is less than, or equal to 0");
} else if (x <= 5) {
    print("This is printed if x is between 1 and 5");
} else {
    print("This is printed if x is greater than 5");
}

if (10 < x <= 20) {
    print("x is greater than 10 and less than or equal to 20");
}

if (x > 10 && y > 10) {
    print("Both x and y are greater than 10");
}

if (4 == 4) {
    print("The '==' operator checks for equality... 4 is equal to 4!");
}

if (x == 5 || y == 5) {
    print("x or y is 5, maybe both...");
}

Boolean veryLargeX = x > 1k;

if (!veryLargeX) {
    print("X is not that large");
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Working with functions

We have already defined `function` as a piece of code which can be executed by either other functions or by the Ceylon
runtime.
But what was missing from that definition is that functions are also values, which means they can be arguments to other
functions, for example.

Check this out!

{% highlight ceylon %}
// a little helper function
Float? askUserForNumber(String question) {
	process.write(question);
	value userX = process.readLine();
	return parseFloat(userX);
}

shared void run() {
    // shorthand notation for functions
	function multiply(Float a, Float b) => a * b;
	function add(Float a, Float b) => a + b;	
	void printResult(Float(Float, Float) operation, Float x, Float y) =>
		print("Result: ``operation(x, y)``");
	
	value multiplication = 0;
	value addition = 1;
	value option = askUserForNumber("Enter ``multiplication`` for multiplication, ``addition`` for addition: ");
	value x = askUserForNumber("Enter x: ");
	value y = askUserForNumber("Enter y: ");

	// assert we got valid input. If not, an error is thrown so the program can not continue!
	assert(is Float option, is Float x, is Float y,
	       option == multiplication || option == addition);
	
	value operation = option == multiplication then multiply else add;
	printResult(operation, x, y);
}
{% endhighlight %}

First, we define a simple function that just asks the user for a number. As it is a top-level function (ie. not nested
inside another function), we must declare its return type (which is the same as `parseFloat`'s return type).

Now, inside the `run` function, we defined two new functions, `multiply` and `add`, using the short notation for functions
with the fat arrow `=>`.
This kind of function can only contain one expression. This is a very common style in Ceylon because usually functions
are broken up into many smaller functions until they become a simple expression. In fact, a function defined in this way
does not even need to have a name. If you just need to pass a function as an argument to another function, but you don't
need to use it anywhere else, you can declare the function without a name as you invoke the other function, as in this
example:

{% highlight ceylon %}
printResult((Float x, Float y) => x * y, 10.0, 3.0);
{% endhighlight %}

This kind of function that does not have a name is called an *anonymous function*. It can also be called a *lambda*, as
the idea has its roots in the [lambda calculus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus).

The long notation for functions is to
use `{ ... }` to wrap all statements the function should execute (like we did for the `askUserForNumber` and `run` functions).

We then defined a function called `printResult` which takes another function, called `operation`, with a type
`Float(Float, Float)`. You might have guessed that this type corresponds to any function that takes two `Float`s as arguments
and returns another `Float`. Not coincidentally, both `add` and `multiply` are examples of just such functions.

A function that returns a `String` and takes only one `Float` would look like this: `String(Float)`.

The program asks the user to enter either `0` for multiplication or `1` for addition, then asks for the values of `x` and `y`.

In the next step, it `assert`s that the user entered valid values!

`assert` can be used for 2 reasons:

* to verify a condition is true and in case it's not, throw an Error. When an Error is thrown, the program does not continue
execution (but there is a mechanism called `try`/`catch` which allows us to handle Errors such as this).
* to narrow the type of a value in conjunction with the `is` operator. After line `assert(is Float x);`, it is guaranteed
that `x` is a `Float`.

Finally, we call `printResult` using the appropriate operation.

Below are some sample runs of the above program:

> Enter 0 for multiplication, 1 for addition: <span style="color: blue;">0</span><br/>
  Enter x: <span style="color: blue;">10</span><br/>
  Enter y: <span style="color: blue;">3</span><br/>
  **Result: 30.0**<br/>
  Enter 0 for multiplication, 1 for addition: <span style="color: blue;">1</span><br/>
  Enter x: <span style="color: blue;">4</span><br/>
  Enter y: <span style="color: blue;">7</span><br/>
  **Result: 11.0**<br/>
  Enter 0 for multiplication, 1 for addition: <span style="color: blue;">2</span><br/>
  Enter x: <span style="color: blue;">10</span><br/>
  Enter y: <span style="color: blue;">5</span><br/>
  <span style="color: red;">ceylon run: Assertion failed</span><br/>
  <span style="color: red;">&nbsp;&nbsp;unviolated is Float option</span><br/>
  <span style="color: red;">&nbsp;&nbsp;unviolated is Float x</span><br/>
  <span style="color: red;">&nbsp;&nbsp;unviolated is Float y</span><br/>
  <span style="color: red;">&nbsp;&nbsp;violated option == multiplication || option == addition</span><br/>
  
The error message in the last run states that the option assertion was violated because option was not multiplication nor addition.

It is considered good practice to keep each function you write (including the `run` function) at most a dozen or so lines long.

The resulting program may be a little longer than it was before, but writing code like this has several benefits:

* every function you write can be re-used in many places (make it `shared` if you want to maximize re-usability - at the cost
  of flexibility, as it gets harder and harder to change functions once they are used in more and more places).
* you only need to keep a small amount of information in your head when you are trying to understand what the code does
  because each function is small.
* each functionality is isolated from others and explicitly declares what is relevant information (its arguments) for it
  to do its job, and what is gives back (the return type).

If the name of the function is not enough for us to understand what it does, well, it probably has a bad name in the first place...
but we should also look at the type signature of a function, which is made up by the types of the arguments (what we pass in)
and the type of the return value (what we get out), when we need to find out the purpose of a function. This is valuable information!

## Representing and using lists

Our maths program is starting to become somewhat useful. But it's still quite limited. For example, it only takes two numbers
as input. What if we wanted to be able to allow the user to enter any number of inputs to perform more complex operations?

We must have a way to represent a list, or sequence of values, not only single values.
You can declare and use a list using the following syntax:

{% highlight ceylon %}
value sequence = [1,2,3];
assert(sequence.first == 1);
assert(sequence[0] == 1);
assert(sequence[1] == 2);
assert(sequence[2] == 3);

// does not compile, item at index 3 does not exist!
assert(sequence[3] == 0);
{% endhighlight %}

In the above example, the type of `sequence` is `[Integer, Integer, Integer]`, which means a *Tuple of 3 Integers*.

The following example shows how the element types are preserved when we take them from a Tuple:

{% highlight ceylon %}
value x = ["Hi", 1, true];
String x0 = x[0];
Integer x1 = x[1];
Boolean x2 = x[2];
{% endhighlight %}

> Tuples are extremely powerful! Read more about them in the [Tour of Ceylon](http://ceylon-lang.org/documentation/1.0/tour/sequences/).

An empty list has type `Empty`, which is synonym with `[]`, so you can write `[] emptyList = [];`.

A list with one or more elements is an instance of `[Element+]`, where `Element`
is a type-parameter, ie. it can be replaced with any actual type.

For example, `[0, 1]` is an instance of `[Integer+]`. `["Hi"]` is an instance of `[String+]`.

A possibly empty list is an instance of `[Element*]`, or equivalently, `Element[]`, where `Element` could be any actual type.

The following examples should clarify things:

{% highlight ceylon %}
// tuple
[Integer, Integer, Integer] s1 = [1,2,3];

[Integer+] s2 = [1, 2, 3];

// the following 2 type declarations are equivalent (maybe-empty list)
Integer[] s3 = [1, 2, 3];
[Integer*] s4 = [1, 2, 3];

// this is fine
[Integer*] s5 = [];
	
// this will not compile!
[Integer+] s6 = [];
{% endhighlight %}

The operator `nonempty` may be used to narrow the type of a list from [Element*] to [Element+]:

{% highlight ceylon %}
[Integer*] sequence = [1, 2];
if (nonempty s) {
    // this would not compile outside the if block as sequence.first could be null
	print("First element is ``sequence.first``");
}
{% endhighlight %}

An alternative way to represent lists uses curly braces rather than square-brackets, as in `{Integer+} list = {1, 2};`.
These are called `Iterable`, while the ones that use square-brackets are called `Sequential`.
They behave much the same way, except that Iterables are evaluated lazily.
Roughly anywhere an `Iterable` is required, you can use a `Sequential`, but not the other way around.

If you have two Iterables which you want to treat as a single one, you can use the `chain` method *chain* one Iterable
to the other, giving a single Iterable:

{% highlight ceylon %}
value a = [1, 2, 3];
value b = [10, 11];
assert(a.chain(b).sequence == [1, 2, 3, 10, 11]);
{% endhighlight %}

> Notice that in the example above, the chain method returns an Iterable which is converted to a Sequence, using the `sequence`
  method, before we compare it to the expected value. That's necessary because Iterable, being a lazily-evaluated structure,
  does not guarantee stability of its elements, so comparing Iterables is generally a bad idea. If you need to ensure stability
  of items on more than one iteration or need to compare Iterables with something else, always convert it to a Sequence first.

A special kind of Sequence is `Range`. A range can be expressed as follows:

{% highlight ceylon %}
value zeroToTen = 0..10;
assert(zeroToTen == [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]);
value lowerCaseCharacters = 'a'..'z';
value firstFiveUpperCaseLetters = 'A':5;
{% endhighlight %}

Anything that is `Ordinal` (ie. have a natural ordering, like Integers and Characters) can be put into a Range.

A really interesting thing you can use Ranges for is to extract just parts of other lists:

{% highlight ceylon %}
value list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
value firstFiveElements = list[0:5];
value thirdToEigthElements = list[2..7]; // indexes start from 0, so the 3rd element has index 2
{% endhighlight %}

> For details about Iterable, Sequential and Range, visit the [Tour of Ceylon](http://ceylon-lang.org/documentation/1.0/tour/sequences/).

## Loops and for-comprehensions

Now that we know how to create lists, we can iterate over them to do something with each item using the `for` statement:

{% highlight ceylon %}
value internationalGreetings = ["Hi", "Ola", "Hej", "Privyet", "Salut"];
for (greeting in internationalGreetings) {
    print(greeting);
}
{% endhighlight %}

This will print each international greeting in turn.

> A `String` is a `[Character*]` in Ceylon, so you can also iterate over each character of it! For example:
  `for (letter in "My Text") { /* do something with each character */ }`

Another way to iterate over elements of a list and do something with them is to use a **comprehension**.
Comprehensions also use the `for` keyword, but unlike the `for` statement we used above, a comprehension evaluates to a value:

{% highlight ceylon %}
value sizeOfGreetings = { for (greeting in internationalGreetings) greeting.size };
print(sizeOfGreetings);
{% endhighlight %}

Running this program prints:

```
{ 2, 3, 3, 7, 5 }
```

This is usually referred to as `mapping` (from Strings to sizes). In fact, the above is equivalent to using the `map`
method, which takes a function (in this case, the method `size` of `String`) and applies it over each item of the list,
returning the resulting *mapped* values:

{% highlight ceylon %}
value sizeOfGreetings = internationalGreetings.map(String.size);
{% endhighlight %}

A related method, which we will need later to complete our maths program, is `fold`.
Whereas `map` applies a function to each item in the list, `fold` uses a function to *collapse* the list into a single value
by accumulating the result of applying the function to each element in sequence.

To do that, it requires an initial value, besides the function to be applied. We can use that to, for example, multiply
all items in a list (the initial value we give is `1.0` because it is the *neutral* value for multiplications):

{% highlight ceylon %}
function multiplyAll(Float* numbers) =>
      numbers.fold(1.0, (Float partial, Float elem) => partial * elem);

// this prints 100.0
print(multiplyAll(2.0, 5.0, 10.0));
{% endhighlight %}

Comprehensions can also be used to eliminate some items from a list, keeping only the ones we are interested in (in other words, filter):

{% highlight ceylon %}
value greetingsStartingWithH = { for (greeting in internationalGreetings)
                                 if (greeting.startsWith("H")) greeting };
print(greetingsStartingWithH);
{% endhighlight %}

Which prints:

```
{ Hi, Hej }
```

The same can also be achieved with the `filter` method:

{% highlight ceylon %}
value greetingsStartingWithH = internationalGreetings.filter((String s) => s.startsWith("H"));
{% endhighlight %}

Awesome or what?

Besides `for`, there is another way of looping called `while`. You can use `while` when you want to loop as long as some
condition holds `true`.

A basic use of `while` would be to allow the user to run a program again and again without having to re-start it:

{% highlight ceylon %}
String askUser(String question) {
	process.write(question);
	return process.readLine();
}

while(askUser("Do you want to continue?").lowercased in ["y", "yes"]) {
	// continue program
}
{% endhighlight %}


## Variadic parameters

Variadic parameters allow a function to take any number of arguments. For example:

{% highlight ceylon %}
void printStrings(String+ strings) {
    for (string in strings) {
        print(string);
    }
}

printStrings("Apple", "Orange", "Pineapple");

// does not compile, must provide at least one String
printStrings();
{% endhighlight %}

To allow empty lists, use `String*` instead of `String+`.

You can pass an Iterable to a function that has variadic parameters by using the *spread* operator (`*`):

{% highlight ceylon %}
value list = ["White", "Blue", "Red", "Black"];
printStrings(*list);
{% endhighlight %}

A variadic parameter must always be the last parameter of a function. The following are valid functions:

{% highlight ceylon %}
function myFunction(Integer a, String* b) { ... }
function otherFunction(Boolean a, Integer b, Float+ c) { ... }
// a function which takes at least 3 Booleans
function oneMoreFunction(Boolean a, Boolean b, Boolean+ c) { ... }
{% endhighlight %}

Enough of theory... now we are ready to write some cool stuff!

## Improving the Maths Helper

Let's get back to our Maths Helper program... we have enough knowledge now to extend it so that we can let the
user enter as many operands as he or she wishes. We can also let the user choose to re-run the program again and again
without re-starting it.

With these requirements in hand, we are ready to start coding!

Below is a possible solution to this problem. Before you look at it, you should definitely try to write it yourself.
You can re-use all the useful functions we have already defined above, like `askUserForNumber`, `multiply`, `add`...
If you get stuck, you may have a look at the solution below to see how it solves the problem you're having. But notice that
this solution is by no means the only solution! You can certainly have a different solution that works just as well and
even better!

{% highlight ceylon %}
String askUser(String question) {
	process.write(question);
	return process.readLine();
}

Float? askUserForNumber(String question) => parseFloat(askUser(question));

{Float*} askUserForNumbers(String question, {Float*} previousAnswers) {
	value answer = askUserForNumber(question);
	if (exists answer) {
		return askUserForNumbers(question, previousAnswers.chain { answer });
	} else {
		return previousAnswers;
	}
}

void runMathsProgram() {
	function multiplyAll(Float* numbers) =>
			numbers.fold(1.0, (Float x, Float y) => x * y);
	function addAll(Float* numbers) =>
			numbers.fold(0.0, (Float x, Float y) => x + y);
	void printResult(Float(Float*) operation, Float* numbers) =>
		print("Result: ``operation(*numbers)``");
	
	value multiplication = 0;
	value addition = 1;
	
	value option = askUserForNumber("Enter: * ``multiplication`` for multiplication,
	                                        * ``addition`` for addition: ");
	if (exists option, option == multiplication || option == addition) {
		value numbers = askUserForNumbers("Enter a number (or just Enter to continue): ", {});
		printResult(option == multiplication then multiplyAll else addAll, *numbers);
	} else {
		print("Invalid option");
	}
}

"Run the Maths helper program."
shared void run() {
	value stars = "*".repeat(10);
	print(stars + " Welcome to the Maths helper " + stars);
	runMathsProgram();
	while(askUser("Do you want to start again? [yes/no]: ").lowercased in ["y", "yes"]) {
		runMathsProgram();
	}
	print("Bye!");
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Some general software development remarks

A lot of things can still be much improved in this program. For example, we could support many more operations.
Or we could provide more meaningful error messages when the user enters invalid input.

In business terms, the initial goal when developing a new product is to release a MVP (Minimum Viable Product). The above
program would be more like a `0.1-beta` version of our product. With each improvement that you make or feature that you add,
you get closer to creating a program that people might actually be interested in using (the `1.0.0` version).

But no program is ever complete. There's always something that can be made better, or bugs to be fixed once the program
gets a little more complex, or things that can be removed because they no longer make sense.
That's why programs always have version numbers. It is an acknowledgement that software development is an iterative process.

You create something small and simple at first, then gradually build more and more on top of it.

It is just like learning code.

You will never know everything there is to know, and given the relatively young age or the software development profession,
nobody really knows what is the best way to create software yet. And this is what makes programming so exciting! We're still
figuring out most of it, and every new programmer can help finding better and smarter ways to code.

## Where to now?

I hope that this tutorial has made you excited about the possibilities of writing code with Ceylon.
A lot of things have been covered: types, values, functions, lists, conditionals, loops, comprehensions!
But there still is many more to learn: custom types, interfaces, alias, objects, mutability, polymorphism, enumerated types,
parameterized types, importing/exporting modules, using third-party [libraries](https://modules.ceylon-lang.org), and so much more.
These, I hope, will be the subject of subsequent parts of this tutorial, so stay tuned!

If you don't fully understood some concept, write code to experiment with it. All experienced programmers
agree that the best way to learn code is to write code. So get your hands dirty and write as much code as you can.

There will be times when you will get frustrated because something doesn't work. This is natural and is an absolute
integral part of programming. As you get more experienced, you will still get stuck sometimes, but on harder and harder
problems. But there are many ways to get over issues.

The first one should always be to think hard about what is going wrong.
Usually you get stuck because one of your assumptions about the code is not quite right. Test your assumptions by writing
simple snippets of code that verify them.

The second thing you should try is have a look at the [Tour of Ceylon](http://ceylon-lang.org/documentation/1.0/tour).
Even though its language is quite advanced (it is mostly aimed at Java developers), there is lots of examples and in-depth
explanations which are probably going to go a long way towards helping you figure out things.

If all your assumptions are correct, the Tour did not help much and still your code does not work, feel free
to post a question on the [Ceylon discussion group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ceylon-users)!
There's lots of people there who will be really happy to help. No question is a stupid question.
All of us who write code probably had the same troubles you're likely to get into, so we know exactly
how it feels and best of all, how to get over them!

That's it for now! Let me know that you enjoyed this tutorial by *starring* this repo! The more stars I get, the more
motivation I will have to keep writing and covering the more advanced (and fun) features of Ceylon.

Happy coding!
