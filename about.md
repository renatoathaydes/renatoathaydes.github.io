Hi! I am a Software Developer working at SmartBear Software doing what I like most: writing software
to help others write software!

I currently live in Stockholm, Sweden... but I was born in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and gained my Computer Science
Degree in Adelaide, Australia, where I lived for many years before moving to Sweden.

### Background

I have worked with Enterprise Java, Web Development (GWT) and Desktop applications (JavaFX and Swing).
 
I also have lots of hobby projects, for which I like to use not only Java, but also Groovy and Ceylon!

You can see all of my projects on my GitHub account (link at the bottom of this page).
