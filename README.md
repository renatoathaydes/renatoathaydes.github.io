# Renato's GitHub Website

This is my GitHub Website Repo.

If you enjoy what you read in my blog, please *start* this repo!

This site hosts my new [blog](http://renatoathaydes.github.io). I decided to move to GitHub because with Jeckyll (which
is used to build this website), the support for styling and highlighting code in just about any language is much better.

My older website can be found [here](http://software.athaydes.com).


Below, some information about Jekyll stuff.

## Other forkable themes

You can use the [Quick Start](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now#quick-start) workflow with other themes that are set up to be forked too! Here are some of  my favorites:
